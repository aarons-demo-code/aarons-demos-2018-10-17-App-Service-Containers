# Azure WebApps, DevOps and the Free Tier :tada:

Let's put a REAL App onto Azure WebApps _for free_.

We'll take the [Athens proxy](https://docs.gomods.io) and push it onto the Azure WebApps free tier.

Check out the [app-service.sh](/app-service.sh) shell script to run through the steps to deploy
Athens to Azure webapps. You'll need an Azure account, but you should be using the 
[Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/) :grin:!

Have fun, Gophers!
